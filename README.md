Notes:

Edit Bash RC so os install works correcly by:

code ~/.bashrc

(Note: This should be .bashrc Placing this line on line 4:
"export CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT=/workspace"
 Should be in .bashrc
)

Then, remember to restart the terminal, so that .bashrc is reloaded

sudo apt-get install subversion

npm install -g opspark

os install
